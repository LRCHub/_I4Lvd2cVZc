I know you told me
Such a long time ago
That you don't want me
You don't love me no more

I wanna know
What makes me such a fool for you

I know you told me
That you don't want me 'round
Yes, I know you got a man
Way 'cross town

I wanna know, yes
What makes me such a fool for you

Did ya ever wake up cryin'
Like you never cried before
Oh Lord, have ya ever cried so loud
You give the blues to your neighbor next door

I wanna know, yes, I do
What makes me such a fool for you

I know you told me
Such a long time ago
That you don't want me
You don't love me no more

I wanna know, yes, I do
What makes me such a fool for you

I wanna know, yes
What makes me such a fool for you
