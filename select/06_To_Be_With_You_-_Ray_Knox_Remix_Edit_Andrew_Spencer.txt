Hold on little man
Show me what he's done to you
Stand up little man
A broken heart can't be that bad
When it's through, it's through
Fate will twist the both of you
So come on baby, come on over
Let me be the one to show you
I'm the one who wants to be with you (I'm the one)
Deep inside I hope you feel it too (you feel it too)
Waited on a line of greens and blues (Waited on a line)
Just to be the next to be with you
Build up your confidence
So you can be on top for once
Wake up who cares about
Little boys that talk too much
I've seen it all go down
Your game of love was all rained out
So come on baby, come on over
Let me be the one to show you
I'm the one who wants to be with you (I'm the one)
Deep inside I hope you feel it too (you feel it too)
Waited on a line of greens and blues (Waited on a line)
Just to be the next to be with you
I'm the one who wants to be with you (I'm the one)
Deep inside I hope you feel it too (you feel it too)
Waited on a line of greens and blues (Waited on a line)
Just to be the next to be with you
